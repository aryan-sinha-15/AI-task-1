Problem Statement:
The robot monitors players with the highest impact on the matchâ€™s outcome.

Description:
- Uses Greedy Best First Search (GBFS) to track high-impact players.
- Prioritizes players based on recent performance metrics like runs, wickets, and fielding impact.

Expected Output:
Top Performing Player: Player B

Conclusion:
GBFS efficiently prioritizes tracking the most impactful players using a heuristic (impact score).
