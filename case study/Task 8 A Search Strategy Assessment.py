"""
Problem Statement:
Robots analyze match strategies to determine the optimal approach for field placement and bowling.

Description:
- Uses A* search algorithm considering field positions and match dynamics.
- Heuristic balances player skills, pitch conditions, and game phase.

Expected Output:
Optimal Strategy: Balanced Field

Conclusion:
A* search helps determine the best fielding strategy by balancing risk and reward.
